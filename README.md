### Hello 👋

I'm Gian, Go software developer with an interest in Cyber Security 👨‍💻. 

Below a list of tools I am using in the Go ecosystem:
- [**gRPC-Go**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), the official gRPC library for Go.
- [**Golang protobuf**](https://github.com/golang/protobuf), the official Google Protocol Buffers implementation for Go.
- [**The gRPC-Gateway**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) a HTTP/JSON <-> gRPC translation layer
